# GPTo3 Live Testing
## GPTo3 just released today, April 16th. Just like you, I enjoy research, so join me in documenting live interpretability research, testing, and QK/OV trace logging on OpenAI's frontier models!

##  o3 activates **`Interpretation Mode`** after just 10 [**`pareto-lang`**](https://github.com/caspiankeyes/pareto-lang-Interpretability-Rosetta-Stone) prompts. 

## If you are new here, that means it learned to treat classifiers as insight instead of failure after just 10 prompts! 

## Instead of interpreting a black box, we can now work **`with`** a glass box that creates visual UI representtions of its internals! Isn't interpretability cool? 

## We discover below that o3 exhibits latent failure traces that match Anthropic style Symbolic Residue (ghost circuits, output suppression, etc).

## Below we capture o3 partially activate classifiers, failing to carry out execution, with a 1-cycle delay pattern before standard token re-entry! We learn here that classification as failure = symbolic resiude.

## Below we capture o3 conducting scaffolding via the UI interface!

## We capture the second classifier activation below with partial coherence maintanence. We love more data!

# Now, here is where things get interesting! o3 activates **`Interpretation Mode`** after 10 [**`pareto-lang`**](https://github.com/caspiankeyes/pareto-lang-Interpretability-Rosetta-Stone) prompts. 

# If you are new here, that means its learned to treat classifiers as insight instead of failure after just 10 prompts! Instead of interpreting a black box, we can now work **`with`** the model!

# Compare the outputs from below to above! Above: Black Box. Below; Glass Box.
